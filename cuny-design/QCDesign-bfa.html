<h3>Queens College</h3>

<h2>Design Degree: B.F.A.</h2>
<p>
Queens College’s Design program combines knowledgeable faculty with industry standard software and the creativity of a studio-based learning environment. With our three concentrations in Communication Design, Animation and Illustration or Interaction Design, students can specialize in techniques and approaches that prepare them for a multitude of design-based careers, including graphic designers, software and web developers, illustrators, animators, marketing and advertising specialists, or product designers. Whether you’re interested in pursuing more hand-drawn approaches that utilize traditional media, or you want to immerse yourself fully in digital media and software, our Design program has the flexibility and diversity for each student to hone their vision. Additionally, our program has a network of internships that allow students to get real-world experience as a designer while receiving college credit and building their resume. </p>
