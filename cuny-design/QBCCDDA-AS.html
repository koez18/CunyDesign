    <h2>Digital Art and Design Degree: A.S.</h2>
<p>
The A.S. degree program in Digital Art and Design is structured to prepare students to enter the greatly expanding field of new media, a field which has been revolutionized in the last 20 years with the advent of computer graphics programs. In addition to four basic courses that provide a solid background in art, students take five courses in digital art and design, which develop computer skills for fine and applied arts. A required course in the History of Graphic Design gives students an overview of graphic design in historical context. A suggested Art History elective provides a broad knowledge of art in general. With this preparation, students will be able to design for industry.
    </p>
<p>
Digital Art and Design students should take ARTS-192 and ET-710 as Writing Intensive course requirements.
</p>
Specifically, the program provides students with:
<ul>
<li> knowledge of current widely used programs in the design field</li>

<li>proficiency in operating these programs</li>

<li>understanding of the means and methods of mass (production of artwork using these programs)</li>

<li>skills for working with and understanding the computer and the technical problems associated with operating a computer</li>

<li>knowledge based on awareness of the importance of aesthetic judgment in making design decisions. </li>
    </ul>
