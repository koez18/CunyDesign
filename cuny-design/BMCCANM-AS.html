<h2>Animation and Motion Graphics Degree: A.S.</h2>
<p>
The Animation and Motion Graphics program provides students with the fundamentals of two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) animation, motion graphics, and special effects. Once necessarily hand-made, expensive and rare, animation has undergone a technical transformation and is now a ubiquitous part of special effect, advertising campaigns, video games, movies, and television.
</p>
<p>
Upon completion of the program requirements, the Associate of Science degree in Animation and Motion Graphics is awarded. Graduates of this program can enter a growing profession or transfer to bachelor-level programs in Animation at Lehman College or other media related programs at senior colleges.
</p>
    
<h4>Transfer Options</h4>
<p>
BMCC has articulation agreements with CUNY Lehman College to allow you to seamlessly continue your education there without any loss of credits.
